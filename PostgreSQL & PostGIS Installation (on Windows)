# What is PostgreSQL and PostGIS?

PostgreSQL is an open-source Object Relational Database Management System (ORDMS). It is also known as Postgres. As a database server,
its main function is to store data securely and return that data in response to requests (e.g. queries) from other software applications.

PostGIS is an open-source software that gives "spatial" capabilities to the PostgreSQL. That is, it adds support for the geographic
objects to the PostgreSQL database management system.

# How to install them on Windows based machine?

Following are the steps to install PostgreSQL and PostGIS on a Windows (7, 8 and 10) based machine.

1) PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) provides interactive installers for Windows based machine. Download one of
such installers from Enterprise DB webpage: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

2) Click Windows (as operating system) and select the appropriate postgresql version you want to download. Note: I still prefer to work
with PostgreSQL 9.5.x version.

3) Run (preferably, Run As Adminitrator) the .exe file downloaded from Enterprise DB.

4) Keep the suggested and default settings including directories. Once prompted, choose the password (you will use this password everytime
you login to the Postgres application).

5) Click Next. Make sure the "Launch Stack Builder at exit?" box is checked and click finish. Note: once checked, Stack builder
will initiate PostGIS installation automatically and will install all dependencies.

6) From the drop down menu, select "PostgreSQL 9.5 server on port 5432". Cick Next.

7) Under "spatial extensions", select the most recent version of PostGIS bundle (PostGIS 2.3 for example).

8) Click Next. Let the installation begin. Make sure create spatial database is checked. Leave the default options.
Make sure you enter your password if needed.

9) Now you should have a fully operational postgresql/postgis database (which completes sucessfull installation).

10) Under Windows programs, find pgAdminIII. Run this program. It is GUI of PotgreSQL database managament system.
Double-click on the Server. Enter the password. Expore the structure of default Postgres databses.

Enjoy Postgres!
