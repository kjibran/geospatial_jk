# After installation of PostgreSQL/PostGIS

Once the installation of PostgreSQL/PostGIS is completed. It is a good idea to "play around" with some SQL. Let's do it!

Right-click on the database and click on "SQL" button in the top panel bar. This will open SQL Editor window.
Important note: First, we will have to activate postgis extension in our database. This is important, every time we want to run postgis
queries in a new database.

To activate postgis, do the following.
In SQL editor, type the follwing and click on "play (execute)" button.

Create Extension PostGIS;

Simply stated, you are now ready to run GIS-based SQL queries in your database.

Let's create a sample table:

``````````````````````````````````````
CREATE TABLE article (
    article_id bigserial primary key,
    article_name varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    article_desc text NOT NULL,
    date_added timestamp default NULL
);
``````````````````````````````````````

Above code will create a sample table in your postgres database. In the moment, we haven't involved any GIS.
Let's run the first query. Type following in the SQL editor. Select it and click play button again.

``````````````````````
Select * from article;
``````````````````````

It means you are querying your database to return all rows and columns of the sample table (you should see
the similar output at the console window).

Let's play with some GIS data. You can any shapefile to the postgres database. Do it by going to Plugins>PostGIS Shapefile Loader
(you can find it in the drop down menu on the top left panel of pgAdminIII).

Click on "Add file". Browse to the shapefile in your machine. Import it.

Now come back to the SQL editor and execute the same command as above. Examine the output in the console output window.

Congreatulations for your very first postgres queries!
